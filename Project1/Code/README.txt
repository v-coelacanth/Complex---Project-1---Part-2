How to run the code. 

Figure 1 and Mutual Information

Matlab scripts to create figure 1 and to create the data files for estimating mutual information are in the directory Matlab for Figure 1.  

To create figure 1 and the data files for the JIDT mutual information binning algorithm, run the Matlab script figure1abcd_combined_with_mi.  This creates files test_mi_cd.txt and test_mi_cd.txt which you can feed to the JIDT AutoAnalyzer. 

To create the data files for JIDT kernel estimator, run the Matlab script part1abcd_kernal. This creates the data files test_kernal_ab.txt and test_kernal_cd.txt which you can feed to the JIDT AutoAnalyzer. 

Figure 2

The code for making the return map (Figure 2) s in the directory Python Version of Pretty Picture.   It is written in Python 3 and requires that Numpy and Matplotlib be installed.  To run the code, issue the command python3 lattice.py and go get a cup of coffee.  The code takes about 4 minutes to run.
