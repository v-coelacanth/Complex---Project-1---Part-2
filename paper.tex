% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:

% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
\noindent Evolution proceeds by emergence of new higher level entities.   How information is stored and processed is a driver of this process \cite{Walker}.   For instance, the emergence of epigenetic inheritance provided a competitive advantage through diversification.  
In this paper, we look at the interaction between organisms as individual  populations and organisms considered as a group of populations. \\ 

\noindent For individual populations, we assume birth rate, death rate, and  carrying capacity are all fixed.  Define $k$ to be the carrying capacity of a population and $n_t$ to be size of the population at time $t$. Then the size of the population at generation $t$ is modeled by 
\begin{eqnarray}
n_{t+1} = (\textnormal{birthrate} - \textnormal{deathrate}) (k n_t - n_t^2) / k 
\end{eqnarray}
If we define the population size relative to the carrying capacity as  $x_t = n_t / k$ and define the reproductive fitness  $r = birthrate - deathrate$.  Then we  get the following equation for $x_t$: 
\begin{eqnarray}
x(t+1) = x_{t+1} = r  x_t (1 - x_t), \ \ \ \ \  t=0, 1, 2, \ldots . 
\label{logistic}
\end{eqnarray}
This is the logistic map as defined in \cite{Mitchell}.  In what follows, we will refer to $x_t$ as the population size, with the understanding that it will always be the ratio of the actual population size to the carrying capacity

In \cite{Walker}, the authors investigate information flow between higher and lower levels of organization, between individuals of a population and the population considered as a whole. 
They study a model that consists of a population of individual populations and examine the direction of the causal information transfer, where 
"non-trivial collective behavior is associated with the degree to which local elements receive information from the global network." \cite{Walker}

Their model, a lattice of  globally coupled logistic maps, is used to investigate the circumstances under which nontrivial collective behavior occurs . It shows how a reversal in the dominant direction of information flow from bottom-up to top-down is correlated with the emergence of collective behavior of the populations.

\section{Methods and Results}

\subsection{Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions for the Logistic Map}

Depending on the value of the reproductive fitness $r$, the logistic map will generate a population size that is stable, periodic, or chaotic over time.  The behavior of the logistic map can vary a great deal with small changes in $x_0$.  This phenomenon is known as {\it sensitive dependence on initial conditions}, where small changes in the input lead to large changes in the output.  In figure \ref{figure1abcd}, we plot four times series showing population versus time for $50$ time steps.   
%r, initial x values and cross entropy
% a = 0.7522
% b = 
% ab mutual information  0.7522

%cd mutual information   0.0471
The mutual information measures the dependence of one random variable on another random variable.   For two random variables $X$ and $Y$, we define the mutual information to be
\begin{eqnarray}
I(X,Y) = \sum_{y \in Y} \sum_ {x \in X} p(x,y) { \log p(x,y) \over {\log p(x)  \log p(y)} }
\end{eqnarray}
When two random variables are independent, their mutual information is $0$.  

We computed the mutual information for the time series in figure \ref{figure1abcd}(a) and figure \ref{figure1abcd}(b).  
The mutual information for the periodic maps in figure \ref{abcd_combined}(a)  is $0.7522$ and the mutual information for the chaotic maps it $0.471$.   This makes sense because after $t=13$, for the periodic maps, you can certainly determine the value one map by knowing the other.  It also makes sense that the mutual information for the chaotic maps should be close to zero because they are chaotic.  

To compute the mutual information, we produced values that could be binned by multiplying each population size by 100 and rounding to the nearest integer.  Then we used the JIDT AutoAnalyzer \cite{JIDT} to compute the mutual information.    To generate figure \ref{figure1abcd} we used Matlab \cite{Matlab} with logistic map equation from \cite{Mitchell}.  

MISSING {\it From instructions:  You might follow Flake?s suggestion of predicting how far into the future two populations are on the same side of 50\% of carrying capacity and use a binary representation. You might use JIDT?s kernel estimator. Explain your choice. }



\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=90mm]{figure1abcd_combined}
    
  \caption{ Population growth over time showing sensitive dependence on initial conditions.  The mutual information for the periodic map (a) is 0.7522.  The mutual information for the chaotic map (b) is 0.0471.}
 \label{figure1abcd}
\end{figure} 

\subsection{The Walker Model}
For this project, we used the  model of coupled growth defined in \cite{Walker}. This model uses a logistic growth model on a lattice of populations coupled with influence from the entire population of populations.  For each time step $n$, the size of population $i$ at time step $n$ is defined to be
\begin{eqnarray}
x_{i, n+1} = (1 - \epsilon) f_i(x_{i,n}) + \epsilon m_n, \ \ \ (i=1, 2, \ldots N)
\label{coupling}
\end{eqnarray}
Here $N$ is the number of time steps, $n$ is the current time step (or generation), and $\epsilon$ is the coupling strength of the model to the entire lattice of organisms.   Here the the local growth dynamics of each population $i$ is defined by 
\begin{eqnarray}
f_i(x_{i,n}) = r_i x_{i,n} (1 - {x_{i,n} \over K})
\label{individual}
\end{eqnarray}
Here $r_i$ is the reproductive fitness of population $i$ and $K$ is the carrying capacity.    

We model the state of the entire lattice at time $n$ is an average of the states of all the populations.  This is called the instantaneous mean field and defined to be
\begin{eqnarray}
M_n = { 1 \over N} \sum _{j=1}^N x_{j,n}
\label{bigM}
\end{eqnarray}
 The mean-field $m_n$ is a measure of how the individual populations are growing at any time-step $j$.  It is defined to be 
 \begin{eqnarray}
 m_n = {1 \over N} \sum_{j=1}^N f_j(x_{j,n})
 \label{littlem}
\end{eqnarray}
The influence of $m_i$ on the entire system is quantified by the parameter $\epsilon$, the coupling strength.  
 
To do our simulation,  we set the carrying capacity $K$ to be 100 for all populations $i$, the number of populations $N = 1000$ and use $10000$ time steps.   We set the initial population size $x_i, 0$ to be $1$.   We also generated a random fitness $r_i$ for each population $i$.   

In figure \ref{prettypicture}, we show the return maps for a selection of coupling strengths $\epsilon$.  

% Figure for part 2
 \begin{figure}[t]
 \centering
    \includegraphics[width=100mm]{prettypicture}
    
    \caption{ Return map for selected values of  the global coupling strength $\epsilon$:  $\epsilon =0$ (magenta), $\epsilon = 0.075$ (red), $\epsilon = 0.1$ (blue), $\epsilon = 0.25$ (orange), $\epsilon = 0.225$ (aqua), $\epsilon = 0.25$ (dark green), $\epsilon = 3 $ (stars) and $\epsilon = 4$ (black)}
 \label{prettypicture}
\end{figure} 

To build the return map, equations \ref{coupling},  \ref{individual}, \ref{bigM},  and \ref{littlem} were implemented  in Python using Numpy \cite{numpy} and Matplotlib \cite{matplotlib}.   The return map shows that when the coupling $\epsilon = 0$,  (magenta) there is not much change in how the overall state of the populations changes from time step to time step.  That is, populations  act as isolated populations.   When $\epsilon > 0$, we see a variety of behaviors. 

It should be noted that there is quite a bit of dependence on the initial fitness values $r_i$   In different runs of the return map, $\epsilon = 0.25$ (dark green) and and $\epsilon = 0.225$ (aqua) populations sometimes form loops and there can be some scatter instead of two fixed points when $\epsilon = 0.3$.  Overall, we see that coupling strengths $0, 0.075, 0.1$ and $0.4$ produce predictably shaped regions, while there can be variation in the regions produced by $\epsilon = 0.2,  \epsilon = 0.225$ and $\epsilon = 0.3$. 

% In figure \ref{eyeglasses}, we see another possible return map.

While return maps that look like figure \ref{prettypicture} seemed to occur more often, it would be interesting to look at the distributions of fitness values $r_i$ that produce the more exotic return maps.  This is outside of the scope of this paper.

\subsection{Direction of Information Flow}
\noindent In order to assess that direction of information flow, from Global to Local scales and vice versa, the authors in \cite{Walker} take advantage of {\it Transfer Entropy}. Transfer Entropy is defined mathematically in \cite{Schreiber} as
$$T^{(k)}_{Y \rightarrow X} = \sum_n p(x_{n+1}, x_n^{(k)}, y_n^{(k)}) \log \left[ \frac{p(x_{n+1}|x_n^{(k)}, y_n^{(k)})}{p(x_{n+1}|x_n{(k)}}\right]$$
Where $x_n^{(k)}$ is an embedded state in the $k$-dimensional phase spate defined as $x_n^{(k)} = (x_n, \cdots, x_{n-k+1})$. \\



\noindent Although Transfer Entropy is a fine candidate to estimate directionality of this coupling, recent work has focused on improving estimation methods. In their 2015 paper, Gencaga et. al propose new "statistically robust" methodology to estimate Transfer Entropy \cite{recipe}. Relevant here, is the considerable improvement for continuous processes, where discretizing the data can lead to a distortion in the underlying probability distribution. For this reason, we choose to use the state of the art TransferEntropy package in R and claim based on this work that these estimates of Transfer Entropy are to be preferred. \\

\noindent In Figure \ref{te}, we see qualitatively similar results as to what was demonstrated in \cite{Walker}. The quantitative difference in the location and magnitude of the peaks can be attributed to either chance or estimation method. For low values of the global coupling parameter ($\epsilon$), we see information flow is stronger in the bottom-down direction (from local to global scale). As $\epsilon$ increases the direction reverses, and top-down causation begins to dominate. We note again that we are qualitatively in agreement with the previous work \cite{Walker}. There is however a subtle quantitative difference in our results. It appears from Figure \ref{te} that this reversal of causation occurs at a value of $\epsilon = 0.3$. In an effort to analyze this claim more rigorously, we repeat the entire simulation and estimation procedure $30$ times. The right panel of Figure \ref{te_avg} shows the difference $T_{M\rightarrow X} - T_{X \rightarrow M}$ as a function of $\epsilon$ for 30 different simulations. The mean is also plotted, and we can see clearly that this reversal of information flow occurs right at $\epsilon = 0.3$. Finally, we note that this result is intuitively satisfactory since it coincides with the black stars in Figure \ref{prettypicture}, the value of $\epsilon$ for which the system is completely synchronized.

\subsection{Additional Analysis}
Here we continue our exploration of the relationship between local and global population dynamics.
